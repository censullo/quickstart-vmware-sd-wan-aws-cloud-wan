== Postdeployment steps

The deployment process should take approximately 10-12minutes to complete.
Once completed, you will have an environment with:

a.	Two SD-WAN virtual edges in two separate Availability Zones
b.	A AWS Cloud WAN Core Network Edge (CNE)
c.	(8) Route-based VPNs to the CNE for (2) segments 


Once the execution succeeds, add the necessary static routes for traffic destined to the branches/on-prem to your workload VPCs route table
