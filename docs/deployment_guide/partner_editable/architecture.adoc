image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:


* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A transit virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* An Internet Gateway that allows the VPC to connect to the Internet.
* In the public subnets, the VMware SD-WAN Edge builds VPN tunnels to the Core Network Edge.
* A Core Network Edge, enabling connectivity to workloads located in the attached VPCs.
* Segmentation from on-premises all the way into the AWS Cloud.
* Amazon CloudWatch to collect logs of the AWS Quick Starts deployment and AWS Lambda execution.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
