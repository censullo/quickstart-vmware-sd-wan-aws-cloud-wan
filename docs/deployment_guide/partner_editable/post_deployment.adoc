// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

Once the deployment has completed, you will have an environment with:

*	Two (2) {partner-software-edge} EC2 instances in two (2) separate availability zones.
*	An AWS Cloud WAN core network edge (CNE).
*	A site&#8209;to&#8209;site route-based VPN connection for each {partner-software-edge} for each segment.
  With a two (2) {partner-software-edge} and two (2) segment configuration, there will be four (4) highly available VPN connections with two (2) VPN tunnels each for eight (8) VPN tunnels total.

After deployment, add the necessary static routes to your workload VPC route tables
Afterward, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-edit-static-routes.html[add the necessary static routes] to your workload VPCs' route tables for traffic destined to your branches/on-premises.

In the event that you need to delete the environment that you previously built, here are the necessary steps required and artifacts that will need to be deleted manually:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-edit-static-routes.html[Delete the static routes] in the workload VPC route tables that were added as part of the post-deployment steps.
* From the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home[CloudFormation console]:
** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html[Delete the root stack], which will automatically delete the other stacks.
* From the https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home#/networks[Network Manager console]:
** Delete the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-attachments-working-with.html[VPC & VPN attachments].
** Delete the core network edge.
** Delete the global network.
* From the https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home[VPC console]:
** Delete the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html[site&#8209;to&#8209;site VPN connections].
** Delete the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.html[customer gateways].
* From the {partner-software-orchestrator} console:
** Delete the hub cluster assigned to the profile and https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/5.0/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-1671E805-3EBF-45AD-A656-99E1CF99DC9C.html[edge cluster] configuration.
