image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. This VPC serves as a transit VPC connecting branch-office network VMware SD-WAN Edges with workload VPCs.
* An internet gateway that allows the transit VPC to connect to the internet.
* In the public subnets, a VMware SD-WAN vEdge cluster deployed to Amazon EC2 instances. The VMware SD-WAN vEdge instances provide full-mesh VPN attachments to the AWS Cloud WAN core network edge.
* An AWS Cloud WAN core network edge for connecting workload VPCs to the transit VPC. This contains two segment networks, or isolated routing domains, to which workload VPCs attach.
* AWS Lambda to make API calls during deployment to configure VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator.
* Amazon CloudWatch for storing the AWS Lambda function logs.
* AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator credentials.
