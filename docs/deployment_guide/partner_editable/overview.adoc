This Quick Start deploys VMware SD-WAN Virtual Edge (vEdge) on the AWS Cloud. It allows enterprises to extend VMware SD-WAN all to the way to the AWS Cloud for users to connect to their workloads running on AWS.

This Quick Start deploys a cluster of vEdge across different Availability Zones in order to achieve high availability. It also brings up a Core Network Edge which allows connectivity to customer workload VPCs and extends segmentation from on-premises into the AWS Cloud.
The VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator provides a single pane of glass for monitoring, reporting and management of the VMware SD-WAN Edges.
