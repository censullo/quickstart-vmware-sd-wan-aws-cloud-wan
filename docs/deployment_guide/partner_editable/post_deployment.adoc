// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

Once the deployment has completed, you will have an environment with:

*	Two (2) SD-WAN virtual edges in two (2) separate Availability Zones.
*	A AWS Cloud WAN Core Network Edge (CNE).
*	Eight (8) route-based VPNs to the CNE for two (2) segments .

Afterward, add the necessary static routes to your workload VPCs' route tables for traffic destined to your branches/on-premises.


In the event you need to delete the environment you previously built, here are the necessary steps required and artifacts that will need to be deleted manually:

* Delete the static routes that were added as part of the post-deployment steps.
* Delete the VPC & VPN https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-attachments-working-with.html[attachments]
* Delete the start.json stack
* Delete the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html[Site-to-Site VPN Connections]
* Delete the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.html[Customer Gateways] 
* Delete the Core Network Edge
* Delete the Global Network
* On the {partner-product-short-name} Orchestrator, delete the Hub cluster assigned to the Branch profile and https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/5.0/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-1671E805-3EBF-45AD-A656-99E1CF99DC9C.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIHYFMAuB3A9gJwNYAIDOCGAbgJYDGCeIAvkA[edge cluster] configuration
