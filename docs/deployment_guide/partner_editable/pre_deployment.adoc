//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

Before using this Quick start, you must:

*	Have an [administrator account] (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/5.0/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-6375F518-3A22-4CDD-B4F0-F0B2EC553869.html) created on the {partner-company-short-name} Orchestrator. 
*	Have a Hub [Profile] (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/5.0/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-D174B662-089C-4EC9-A389-682363C40ADF.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIA4CcD2AzAlhApgZxAXyA) already created, which will be assigned to the Hub Cluster.
*	Have [segments] (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SD-WAN/5.0/VMware-SD-WAN-Administration-Guide/GUID-E462C603-C931-4897-BFC2-7F61D15CD043.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIM4FMDmBbBA7ALnEBfIA) already defined on the {partner-company-short-name} Orchestrator.
*	Have a policy file already defined for the AWS Cloud WAN. See example [here] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policy-examples.html)
*	Ensure that the account quotas for Amazon VPC and Site-to-Site VPN are sufficient for the desired deployment configuration.

IMPORTANT: In this document, we assume that for every VPC attachment there's only one subnet part of that VPC.

IMPORTANT: In this document, we assume thereâ€™s no other "NSD via Edge" configuration. Existing NSD via Edge configurations may cause the deployment to fail.
