== Postdeployment steps

Once the deployment has completed, you will have an environment with:

*	Two (2) SD-WAN virtual edges in two (2) separate Availability Zones.
*	A AWS Cloud WAN Core Network Edge (CNE).
*	Eight (8) route-based VPNs to the CNE for two (2) segments .

Afterward, add the necessary static routes to your workload VPCs' route tables for traffic destined to your branches/on-premises.
