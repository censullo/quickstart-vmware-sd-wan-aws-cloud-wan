As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two availability zones.
* A transit virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* An internet gateway that allows the transit VPC to connect to the internet.
* In the public subnets, the {partner-software-edge} EC2 instances that build VPN tunnels to the AWS Cloud WAN core network edge.
* An AWS Cloud WAN core network edge, enabling connectivity to workloads located in the attached VPCs.
* Segmentation from on-premises all the way into the AWS Cloud.
* An AWS Lambda function for making API calls to configure the {partner-software-orchestrator} ({partner-software-orchestrator-short}).
* Amazon CloudWatch for storing the AWS Lambda function's execution logs.
* AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing the {partner-software-orchestrator-short} credentials.
